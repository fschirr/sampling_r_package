\description{
\code{CreateEcologist} creates a vector with characteristics of the behaviour
of an ecologist in the field. The characteristics are: The sampled area of a
plot, the detection probability, the identification error, the probability
of missed vistis and the costs. The first four characteristics are expected
to be in percent.
